# Basic ray-tracer in C++

The goal of this project is to get familiar with c++ and learn the basics of computer graphics.

## Current features 

 - muliple plane and sphere objects
 - multiple lights (only infinite point light)
 - matte material, has only diffuse and ambient.
 - phong material, has also specular using Bling-Phong.
 - reflective material

I'm still working and I'll add new features soon.

## Running the code
I provided a simple make file that compiles the code to an executable.

 1. Run `make` this creates a raytracer executable
 2. Then run `./raytracer` to run the program
 3. The output will be in an out.ppm file.
